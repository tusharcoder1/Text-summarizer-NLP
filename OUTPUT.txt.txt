within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data,
while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data. programming
 language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes and database theory 
concerns the management of repositories of data. computer architecture describes construction of computer 
components and computer-operated equipment. cryptography and computer security study the means for secure 
communication and prevent security vulnerabilities. humanâ€“computer interaction investigates the interfaces 
through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles 
behind developing software.
