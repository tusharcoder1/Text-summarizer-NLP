Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information.Computer science spans 
theoretical disciplines, such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory, to 
practical disciplines including the design and implementation of hardware and software.Computer 
science is generally considered an area of academic research and distinct from computer 
programming.Algorithms and data structures have been called the heart of computer science.
The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of 
problems that can be solved using them. Cryptography and computer security study the means 
for secure communication and prevent security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and 
computational geometry study the generation of images. Programming language theory considers 
approaches to the description of computational processes and database theory concerns the 
management of repositories of data. Humanâ€“computer interaction investigates the interfaces 
through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design 
and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and 
embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer 
architecture describes construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. 
Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such 
as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in 
humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process 
image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and 
linguistic data.
